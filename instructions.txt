EmployeeManager5

Hi Developer 👋,

EmployeeManager5 is a .NET 10 Blazor Server application for managing employees and departments. It provides full CRUD functionality, communicates with a backend Web API for data operations, and demonstrates a clean separation between UI, API, and domain layers.

Features

Employees Management — Create, edit, delete, and view employee details

Departments Management — Create, edit, delete, and view department details

Form Validation — Required fields and validation feedback

Navigation — Top navigation and sidebar for quick access

Responsive UI — Uses Bootstrap for mobile and desktop layouts

Not Found Pages — Gracefully handles invalid or missing resources

Architecture Overview

The solution follows a layered structure:

Layer	Responsibility
Domain	DTOs, shared contracts, and service interfaces
API	Controllers, data services, and EF Core DbContext
UI (Blazor Server)	Pages/components that call the API via HttpClient
Getting Started
Step 1 — Clone and Run EmployeeManager3

Clone the original API/UI solution:

git clone https://github.com/shamshar/EmployeeManager3.git


Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or newer.

Run database migrations via Package Manager Console:

Update-Database


This applies all migrations and creates the local database used by the API.

Step 2 — Clone EmployeeManager5

Clone the updated repository:

git clone https://github.com/shamshar/EmployeeManager5.git


Once opened, ensure the appsettings.json in the API project has a valid connection string.
Use the same connection string as in Step 1 to connect to the database containing all tables and seeded data.

Step 3 — Run the Solution

Set both API and UI projects as startup projects and run the solution.

Access the UI at:

https://localhost:<port>/employees
